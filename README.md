# passwordfile
C++ library to read/write key-value pairs from/to AES-256 encrypted files.
It allows to organize the key-value pairs in tables within an hierarchical
structure. The data can be compressed with gzip before applying the encryption.

## Build instructions
The passwordfile library depends on c++utilities and is built in the same way.
It also depends on OpenSSL and zlib.
